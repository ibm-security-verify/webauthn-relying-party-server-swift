# IBM Security Verify WebAuthn Relying Party Server for Swift


The IBM Security Verify WebAuthn Relying Party Server for Swift is based on the [Vapor](https://vapor.codes) framework and exposes endpoints that proxies OAuth and FIDO2 requests to IBM Security Verify from web and mobile clients.

### Getting started

The resource links in the prerequisites explain and demonstrate how you create a new tenant and automate the application and FIDO2 configuration used by the Relying Party Server.

### Prerequisites

- Create a free trial tenant here: https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-30041. 

    You'll need to have an IBMid but this can be done at the same time.  

    This link explains setting up your tenant: https://docs.verify.ibm.com/verify/docs/signing-up-for-a-free-trial


- Create an API client on the trial tenant.  See this [configuration guide](https://docs.verify.ibm.com/verify/docs/create-api-client) for instructions.

    Ensure the API client has the following entitlements:
    - Read identity providers
    - Manage application lifecycle
    - Read application configuration
    - Manage second-factor authentication method configuration


- Clone the relying party repository.  Run this command in a Terminal window:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/ibm-security-verify/webauthn-relying-party-server.git
    ```


    Modify the `config.json` to use the client identifier and client secret from the API client created in the previous step.
    
    > The `relyingPartyHostname` is the Docker host where you'll run the relying party server.
    
    
    Below is a sample of `config.json`.

    ```
    {
        "tenantUrl":"https://example.verify.ibm.com",
        "clientSecret":"abc123",
        "clientId":"abc123-a1b2-4567-a1b2-c3d4e5f6", 
        "appName": "Passkey Starter Kit",
        "relyingPartyHostname": "example.com"
    }
    ```

    Use the `starter-kit.py` to create the application and a FIDO2 relying party on your tenant.

    Run this command to create the application and a FIDO2 relying party: 

    ```
    python3 starter-kit.py -f config.json
    ```

    The output of `starter-kit.py` is an `.env.env` file which can be used to configure the relying party server environment variables.  The `.env` file will be located in the same folder where `starter-lit.py` is executed from.


## Configuring the server

### Environment variables
The relying-party-server requires several environment variables to launch.

#### `PLATFORM`

The platform flag indicates if the relying party server is IBM Security Verify (ISV) or IBM Security Verify Access (ISVA). For example:
```
PLATFORM=ISV
```

#### `APPLE_APP_SITE_ASSOC`

This is a string to represent the JSON for Apple to establish a secure association between domains and your app. The following JSON code represent the contents of a simple association:
```
{
    "webcredentials":{
        "apps":[
            "ABCDE12345.com.example.app"
        ]
    }
}
```

The JSON content should be minified when assigned to the environment variable. For example:

```
APPLE_APP_SITE_ASSOC={"webcredentials":{"apps":["ABCDE12345.com.example.app"]}}
```

In addition, your iOS mobile app requires an assoicated domain entry that references the `relyingPartyHostname`.  For example:
```
webcredential:example.com
```

See [Supporting associated domains](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/supporting-associated-domains) for more information.



#### `GOOGLE_ASSET_LINKS`

This is a string to represent the JSON for Google to associate login credentials between an app and website. The following JSON code represent the contents of a simple assetlink format:
```
[{
  "relation": ["delegate_permission/common.get_login_creds"],
  "target": {
    "namespace": "web",
    "site": "https://example.com"
  }
 },
 {
  "relation": ["delegate_permission/common.get_login_creds"],
  "target": {
    "namespace": "android_app",
    "package_name": "com.example.app",
    "sha256_cert_fingerprints": [
      "DE:AD:BE:EF:****"
    ]
  }
 }]
```

The JSON content should be minified when assigned to the environment variable. For example:

```
GOOGLE_ASSET_LINKS=[{"relation":["delegate_permission/common.get_login_creds"],"target":{"namespace":"web","site":"https://example.com"}},{"relation":["delegate_permission/common.get_login_creds"],"target":{"namespace":"android_app","package_name":"com.exampl.app","sha256_cert_fingerprints":["DE:AD:BE:EF:****"]}}]
```

See [Google digital asset links](https://developers.google.com/digital-asset-links/v1/getting-started) for more information.



#### `FIDO2_RELYING_PARTY_ID`

This is the unique identifier (UUID) that is created when the FIDO2 service is created in IBM Security Verify.  For example:
```
FIDO2_RELYING_PARTY_ID=634cd513-dc6a-5e28-06fg-40c3dc81a79e
```

See [Retrieve the list of relying party configurations](https://docs.verify.ibm.com/verify/reference/list_3-2) for more information or [Look up Relying Party ID](https://docs.verify.ibm.com/verify/docs/fido2-login#look-up-relying-party-id).

#### `API_CLIENT_ID` and `API_CLIENT_SECRET`

This is the unique client identifier and confidential client secret that the relying party server uses internally to establlished an authenticated session with the FIDO2 and factors endpoints.  For example:
```
API_CLIENT_ID=40c3dc81a79e-dc6a-5e28-06fg-634cd513
API_CLIENT_SECRET=a1b2c3d4
```


See [FIDO2](https://docs.verify.ibm.com/verify/docs/fido2-login) for more information.

#### `AUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`

This is the unique client identifier and confidential client secret that the relying party server uses internally to establlished an authenticated session with the OIDC token endpoints. For example:
```
AUTH_CLIENT_ID=40c3dc81a79e-dc6a-5e28-06fg-634cd513
AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=a1b2c3d4
```

See [Client Credentials](https://docs.verify.ibm.com/verify/docs/get-an-access-token) for more information.

#### `BASE_URL`

The base URL is the fully qualified hostname of your tenant.  For example:
```
BASE_URL=https://example.verify.ibm.com
``` 

#### `HTTP_PROXY`

(OPTIONAL) Enable proxy requests to the relying party server to be forwarded to host defined by `BASE_URL`. For example:
```
HTTP_PROXY=https://proxy.example.verify.ibm.com:8888
```
 

> NOTE: Authenticated proxy is supported by setting the environment variable as:
 ```
HTTP_PROXY=https://username:password@proxy.example.verify.ibm.com:8888
```


#### `ROOT_CA`

(OPTIONAL) Add an additional certificate to the trust store for TLS request validation. For example:
```
ROOT_CA=t4Ck1jbktkQT09Ci0tLS0tRU5EIENFUlRJRklDQVRFLS0tLS0=
``` 

> NOTE: The `ROOT_CA` value must be base64 encoded from Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) certificate text.


#### `LOG_LEVEL`

(OPTIONAL) Output log messages for diagnostic purposes. Below are the acceptable values and descriptions.
| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| TRACE | Appropriate for messages that contain information normally of use only when tracing the execution of a program. |
| DEBUG | Appropriate for messages that contain information normally of use only when debugging a program. |
| INFO | Appropriate for informational messages. |
| NOTICE | Appropriate for conditions that are not error conditions, but that may require special handling. |
| WARNING | Appropriate for messages that are not error conditions, but more severe than notice. |
| ERROR | Appropriate for error conditions. |
| CRITICAL | Appropriate for critical error conditions that usually require immediate attention. |

> NOTE: Default is the `INFO` logging level. When run with the production environment, `NOTICE` is used to improve performance.
